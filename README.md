**Bedrock Service Integration** ü§ñ
_A streamlined approach to leveraging Bedrock services in Python applications_

üìñ Description
---------------
The Bedrock Service Integration project aims to provide a seamless interface for interacting with Bedrock services in Python applications. This project utilizes the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to establish a connection with the Bedrock agent runtime, enabling the invocation of Bedrock services from within Python code. The primary goal of this project is to simplify the process of integrating Bedrock services into Python applications, promoting a more efficient and scalable development workflow.

At the core of this project is the `bedrock.py` module, which encapsulates the logic for interacting with the Bedrock agent runtime. This module provides a straightforward interface for calling Bedrock services, allowing developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about the intricacies of Bedrock service integration. The `myEvent` class in the `__init__.py` file demonstrates how to leverage the `bedrock.py` module to invoke Bedrock services, showcasing the simplicity and elegance of this integration approach.

The Bedrock Service Integration project is designed to be highly extensible, allowing developers to easily add support for new Bedrock services as needed. By providing a modular and flexible architecture, this project enables developers to build a wide range of applications that leverage the power of Bedrock services. Whether you're building a simple web application or a complex enterprise-level system, the Bedrock Service Integration project provides a solid foundation for integrating Bedrock services into your Python applications.

üì¶ API Reference
-----------------
The Bedrock Service Integration project provides a simple API for invoking Bedrock services. The `call_bedrock_service` function in the `bedrock.py` module takes a `question` parameter, which is used to invoke the corresponding Bedrock service.
```python
def call_bedrock_service(question):
    # Implementation
    pass
```
This API can be used to integrate Bedrock services into your Python applications, promoting a more efficient and scalable development workflow.
